### Hi there, I'm Andy 👋

<!--
**Codycoder/Codycoder** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 💾 I'm an associate teacher (C#/.NET Core and JavaScript) at [We Can Code It](https://wecancodeit.org/), a Cleveland, Ohio coding bootcamp.  
- ❕ I believe anyone can learn anything if they have the passion/interest.
- 🚗 Troubleshooting code is exactly like going through the steps to see why your car won't start. Battery charged? Does it have gas? Is the backend of your API running? Did you put the link to your stylesheet into your index.html? Etc. 
- 📼 My first computer was a Mac iici and a dialup modem. Nothing will ever be as sweet as that loyal little box quietly running SimCity all night. 
- 📚 Super interested in tech culture in general, especially from less-heard-from perspectives. 
- ▶️ Love writing learning resources, interacting with people and teaching code. Always learning from my students and colleagues! 
- 📰 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndyKohler1) is my newspaper. 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 💬 Ask me about how 99% of my JavaScript errors are a missing period. 
- 🆗 I make small monthly donations to worthy causes like [California Sun](https://www.californiasun.co/) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Twitter or [try this](mailto:andykohler99@gmail.com).
