### Hi there, I'm Andy 👋

<!--
**Codycoder/Codycoder** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

- 💾   I'm a grad and past teacher (C#/.NET Core and JavaScript) at [We Can Code IT](https://wecancodeit.org/), a Cleveland, Ohio coding bootcamp.  
- ❕   I believe anyone can learn anything if they have the passion/interest.
- 🚗   Troubleshooting code is exactly like going through the steps to see why your car won't start. 
    - Battery charged?
    - Does it have gas? 
    - Is the backend of your API running? 
    - Did you put the link to your stylesheet into your index.html? Etc. 
- 📼   My first computer was a [Mac IIci](https://lowendmac.com/1989/mac-iici/). Nothing will ever be as sweet as that loyal box quietly running SimCity all night. 
- 📚   Fascinated by the periphery around tech, especially less-heard-from perspectives. 
- ▶️   Love writing technical resources, interacting with people and teaching code. Always learning from my students and colleagues! 
- 📰   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndyKohler1) is my newspaper. 
- ⭐   Medium got me interested in developing back in 2016 and [sometimes I publish things there](https://medium.com/@akohler). 
- 😄   Pronouns: he/him/his
- 💬   Ask me about how 99% of my JavaScript problems are based on a typo. 
- 🆗   I make small monthly donations to worthy causes like [California Sun](https://www.californiasun.co/) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
