### Hi there, I'm Andy 👋

<!--
**Codycoder/Codycoder** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 💾  I'm a grad and past teacher (C#/.NET Core and JavaScript) at [We Can Code IT](https://wecancodeit.org/), a Cleveland, Ohio coding bootcamp. 
- ❕   I believe anyone can learn anything if they have the passion/interest, especially coding. 
- 🚗  Troubleshooting code is exactly like going through the steps to see why your car won't start. 
    - Battery charged?
    - Does it have gas?  
    - Did you put the link to your stylesheet into your index.html? Etc. 
- 📼   My first computer was a [Mac IIci](https://lowendmac.com/1989/mac-iici/). Nothing will ever be as sweet as that loyal box quietly running SimCity all night. 
- 📚   Fascinated by the periphery around tech, especially less-heard-from perspectives. 
- ▶️   Love reading/writing technical resources, interacting with people and sharing knowledge. Always learning from others! 
- 📰   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndyKohler1) was my newspaper but I've backed off a bit.  
- ⭐   Medium got me interested in developing back in 2016 and [sometimes I publish things there](https://medium.com/@akohler). 
- 😄   Pronouns: he/him/his
- 🆗   I make small monthly donations to worthy causes like [California Sun](https://www.californiasun.co/) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
